          Some Mpls Jr Devs spaces may have additional rules in place, which

        <p>
          Mpls Jr Devs is dedicated to providing a welcoming, inclusive
          community. We come from all kinds of backgrounds with life stories and
          circumstances, and our diversity is our strength. We are here for
          support, camaraderie, and to help each other as we further our
          journeys.
        </p>
        <p>
          We welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This
          includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity,
          culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and
          economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender
          identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief,
          religion, and mental and physical ability.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves
          professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other
          participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren&#39;t
          acceptable, and will not be tolerated in any form.

          </li>
          <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Mpls Jr Devs prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged
          people’s comfort. Mpls Jr Devs organizers reserve the right not to act
          on complaints regarding:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism’ and ‘reverse sexism’
          </li>
          <li>
            Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,”
            “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Criticizing racist, sexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or
            assumptions
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reporting</h2>

        <p>
          If you are being harassed by a member of Mpls Jr Devs, notice that
          someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
          contact the Mpls Jr Devs organizers at{' '}
          <a
            href="mailto:mplsjrdevs@gmail.com"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            mplsjrdevs@gmail.com
          </a>. If the person who is harassing you is on the organizing team,
          they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will
          respond as promptly as we can.
        </p>
        <p>
          This code of conduct applies to Mpls Jr Devs spaces, but if you are
          being harassed by a member of Mpls Jr Devs outside our spaces, we
          still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of
          harassment by Mpls Jr Devs members, especially Mpls Jr Devs
          organizers, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and
          harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team
          reserves the right to exclude people from Mpls Jr Devs based on their
          past behavior, including behavior outside Mpls Jr Devs spaces and
          behavior towards people who are not in Mpls Jr Devs.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the
          right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith.
          Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted
          without response.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting
          victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person
          about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn
          third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase
          the safety of Mpls Jr Devs members or the general public. We will not
          name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
        </p>

        <h2>Consequences</h2>

        <p>
          Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
          comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior,
          Mpls Jr Devs organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up
          to and including expulsion from all Mpls Jr Devs spaces and
          identification of the participant as a harasser to other Mpls Jr Devs
          members or the general public.
