      Hey there, I&#39;m Jordan!
      <br />
      <br />
      I am a recent graduate of Prime Digital Academy who is just getting
      started with a career in technology. I previously worked as a chef at many
      restaurants throughout the Twin Cities, so naturally I love food.
      <br />
      <br />
      I love building new projects with React, but I'm eager to learn anything I
      can get my hands on.
      <br />
      <br />
      So much to learn, so little time.
