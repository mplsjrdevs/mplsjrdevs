      Hi, I&#39;m Nate!
      <br />
      <br />
      I graduated from Case Western Reserve University (it's in Cleveland, OH)
      in 2019 with a BA in Computer Science. I couldn't wait to get back to Mpls
      and start my journey as a developer with the awesome tech community here!
      I'm currently an organizer for Mpls Jr Devs.
      <br />
      <br />
      My tech passions include IoT, Mobile Development, and AR!
